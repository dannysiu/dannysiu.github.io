If you are confused about anything or just want the general gist of my prior experiences, my resume can be found [here](https://github.com/dannysiu/dannysiu.github.io/edit/master/Danny_Siu_Resume.pdf), which can help give you a little more background before reading into the details of my projects and website. 



You can access the following digital work that I have done (alongside other collaborators) on this website. 
I worked on a [club website](https://lhsmbc.weebly.com/) with my webmaster Richard Liang to provide resources and weekly schedules for my club members. This was for the Mindbenders Club, a club devoted to learning how to solve all kinds of puzzles, which I founded and ran my junior and senior year of high school.
I also worked on multiple science projects, creating a password checker to help users [make secure passwords](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/156JEsLcTGpvHBU-K7qc9XooFHSUw8WnqGGBrgfEZzhM/edit?usp=sharing),
and analyzing the [effects of brainwave entrainment on orb-weaver spiders](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u4B8xCdYeZR80ZbcKXOvt5HCpNcHCRkXaE4FoFWpNbo/edit?usp=sharing) (collab. with Adam Moss). 
In the summer of 2016, I simulated [IR spectroscopy and binding energy calculations on the binding of CO on 55-atom Gold-Palladium nanoparticles](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WC8fQKI24fcaBRfWwGQFmU_gR5u_Ocau). 
My research was done in collaboration with Jake Martin in the Computational Chemistry Stream under Dr. Juliana Duncan as part of the Freshman Research Initiative Program at the University of Texas at Austin, although I was just a high school rising senior at the time. 



Overall, hope you enjoy my website and getting to know a little more about me!
